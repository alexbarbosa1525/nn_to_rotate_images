# nn_to_rotate_images

## Computer Vision Task

That's a Computer Vision problem to identify rotate images according to their labels and correct the direction.
My best model until now was a convolutional neural network, with a accuracy of 85% with 10 epochs. 

To do:

- Test with 20 epochs
- Tune the model
- Try other models and tune the best one.
